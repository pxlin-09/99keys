# Project Description

### Basic Functions:

opening page, in dashboard/floorplans where no image is added

<img width=500 src="https://github.com/pxlin-09/99keys/blob/main/screenshots/ss1.png"/>

the user can add image by clicking on the add button and choosing the file from local device

<img width=500 src="https://github.com/pxlin-09/99keys/blob/main/screenshots/ss2.png"/>

then the user can drag the image into the safe zone and make modifications, in the example below, the image is rotated and zoomed in

the user may also set the fields for the image and save it. Clicking the save button will add the resulting image and fields to the left scroll bar, if the user wants to drag saved images back into safe zone, the saved fields will also appear

Other pages are implemented with a dummy page and a corresponding URL. The horizontal navbar has a responsive path instead of a dummy value, clicking on the location on the navbar will bring you to the corresponding page. This is done to improve scalability

Finally, the about, contact, support buttons on the bottom of the page redirects to 99Key's home page.
